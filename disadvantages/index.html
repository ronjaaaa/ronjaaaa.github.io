      <h2>Disadvantages of being a vampire:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>You can’t venture out into the sunlight as it will destroy you. No more walks in the beautiful sunlight or lying in it for a tan. If you want to do anything good you will have to set out only at night – unless you find a country where the sun hardly shines.</li>
        <li>Living forever can also be a disadvantage as all your friends and your family will age, but you won’t. You will have to make new friends year after year, unless you have only other vampire friends. Also, living for that long could make life extremely boring as you will run out of interesting things to do.</li>
        <li>You will have to give up the joy of eating any food as all you can feed on and digest is blood. This could be a cruel thing to do too. If you’re a good person you won’t enjoy feeding on others blood.</li>
        <li>You could become a cruel being, feared by, and isolated from others.</li>
      </ul>
