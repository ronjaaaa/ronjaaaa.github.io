      <p>Now that you know everything you need to know about being a vampire, you're definitely ready to become one. However you shouldn't feel pressured since once you have become one there's no turning back.<br>
        If your decision is for the life as a vampire then here are some ways of turning into one:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>You might actually have been born as a vampire but haven't noticed yet. Typically, you have your awakening at the ages of 11, 12, 13 or 14. During this awakening you'll get vampire traits like sharp teeth and the thirst for blood.</li>
        <li>Consuming the blood of a vampire is a methode that will turn you without any problems. Vampire blood is really strong which is why even just one drop is enough.</li>
        <li>The most famous way is getting bitten by a vampire. However this method doesn't always work and is realy dangerous because a lot vampires like to drink their victims empty which would results in your death. If that isn't what you want then you should probably try one of the other ways.</li>
        <li>Of course there's also multiple spells. Incase you're interested in this method here's a link to a really authentic website that has all the spells you need: <a href="https://www.spellsofmagic.com/spells/fantasy_spells/vampire_spells/page.html"></a></li>
